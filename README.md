* Int4 or even smaller quantized LLaMA now avaiable! https://github.com/megvii-research/Sparsebit/blob/main/large_language_models/llama/quantization/README.md

# llama_infer
Inference script for Meta's LLaMA models using Hugging Face wrapper as in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/21955

For the 65B model:
||fp16|int8(bitsandbytes)|
|--|--|--|
|V100|OK, 5xV100|Bad results, short generated sequences|
|A100|OK, 6xA100 when using "auto"|OK, 3xA100|

Note that I didn't tweak the device_map for the case of A100 fp16. I expect it would be possible to reduce to somewhere near 4xA100 .

## First install from source
```
git clone https://github.com/zphang/transformers.git --branch llama_push --depth=1
cd transformers
python3 setup.py develop --user
```

## Second convert the weights
```
python3 src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py \
    --input_dir /path/to/downloaded/llama/weights \
    --model_size 7B \
    --output_dir /data/llama/hf/
```

Here we assume the converted weights are in `/data/llama/hf/` .

### Hack for tokenizer (may not be required)
If tokeinizer complains, please setup a soft link to make it happy.
```
/data/llama/hf/65b/tokenizer$ ls -lh
total 496K

## 7B model

### int8 (decent now after removing extra EOS)
```python3 test_llam.py --do_int8 --low_cpu_mem_usage --variant 7b --model_path /data/llama/hf/```

Puma is a 1996 film starring Jackie Chan and Leslie Cheung Kwok-wing.
The film's soundtrack was composed by Shigeru Umebayashi, who was nominated for the Golden Horse Award for Best Score at the 24th Golden Horse Awards.boldsquo;s first martial arts film in a decade, PUMA is a remake of the 1976 Shaw Brothers film Fist of Fury.

Puma is a 1980’s classic that has stood the test of time. With its sleek design and sporty look, Puma is a shoe that can be worn with anything and everything.
The Puma Suede is a sneaker that was introduced in 1968 by Adi Dassler and his brother Rudi. The Suede’s design was inspired by the moccasin shoes that Native Americans wore in the 19th century. It was originally called Clyde Court, after Walt Clyde Frazier, a basketball player for the New York Knicks.\nThe first version of the Puma Suede was made of leather and had a rubber sole. Later, the design was changed to a canvas upper and a plastic wedge heel. This version was more popular and is the one that we know today.
Today, the Puma Suede is one of the most popular
